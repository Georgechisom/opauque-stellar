/**
 * Verify THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md matches the current dependency trees and
 * that every non-permissive-licensed (or unrecognized-license) dependency
 * has an explicit, reviewed entry (#470).
 *
 * Fails when:
 *   - THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md is missing or stale (regenerate with
 *     `npm run notices:generate` and commit the diff).
 *   - A dependency's license is not in PERMISSIVE_LICENSES and not an
 *     explicitly reviewed entry in REVIEWED_NON_PERMISSIVE — this is what
 *     makes a newly-added copyleft/unknown-license dependency fail CI
 *     instead of silently shipping unnoticed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/verify-third-party-notices.ts
