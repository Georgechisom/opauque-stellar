        <p>
          The Opaque reference app does not require an account, name, email address, or
          custodial profile to use protocol features. Normal wallet use happens in your
          browser and through your selected Stellar wallet and network providers.

        <h2 className="text-white font-medium text-base mb-2">Local storage</h2>
        <p>
          Ghost addresses, pool notes, transaction logs, preferences, and recovery data
          may be stored locally on your device. This data is needed to discover receives,
          sweep funds, and restore wallet state. Clearing browser storage, losing a
          device, or losing a backup password can cause permanent loss of access.

          Stellar ledger data is public. Contract calls, timestamps, amounts, fees,
          nullifiers, fee-payer accounts, and public proof inputs may be visible to
          anyone. RPC, Horizon, wallet, relayer, gateway, and indexer providers may also
          observe request timing, IP metadata, queried contracts, and account lookups
          depending on how you connect.

          details, wallet addresses, transaction hashes, screenshots, and other context
          you choose to provide. Reports are used for support, abuse triage, security
          review, and legal compliance. Do not put private keys, seed phrases, passwords,

          Opaque reduces some forms of linkability, but it does not provide full
          anonymity. Review these limits before using stealth payments, privacy pools,

        <p>
          Local wallet data remains under your browser profile unless you export it,
          clear it, or send it to another service. Public ledger data cannot be deleted
          by Opaque. Support reports are retained only as needed for response, security,
          compliance, and recordkeeping.
